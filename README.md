# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study

Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)

## Background context
You are a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The marketing director believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Ask
### Business Task

Devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.

### Analysis Questions

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?  
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Prepare

Cyclistic’s historical trip data trends from Jan 2023 to Dec 2023 from [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). **Motivate International Inc.** has made the data available under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

This is the public data that can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. However, note that data privacy issues prohibit riders from using personally identifiable information. This means we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

## Process

I added two columns "ride_length" and "day_of_week" to each .csv file using spreadsheet.
